# Privacy Policy for Asseta

**Last Updated**: December 2025

## Introduction

Asseta ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Asseta handles information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## Information We Collect

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

Asseta stores the following information locally on your device using iOS's built-in data storage:

- **Asset Information**: Names and values of assets you create
- **Financial Data**: Historical values and dates you record for your assets
- **App Preferences**: Your selected currency and anonymize setting

**Important**: All data is stored exclusively on your device. We do not have access to, collect, transmit, or store any of your data on external servers.

## How We Use Your Information

Since all data remains on your device:

- Data is used solely within the App to calculate and display your net worth and analytics
- Data is shared with the widget extension (via Apple's App Groups) to display information on your home screen
- No data is transmitted to third parties or external servers
- No data is used for advertising or analytics purposes
- No data is shared with other apps on your device (except the widget extension)

## Data Security

- All data is stored using Apple's SwiftData framework, which provides secure, encrypted storage on your device
- Your device's standard security measures (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID) protect your data
- We do not store any data on our servers because we do not have servers
- Data is automatically encrypted when your device is locked

## Data Sharing

**We do not share your data with anyone.** Specifically:

- We do not share data with third parties
- We do not sell data to advertisers
- We do not use analytics services that track your usage
- We do not collect crash reports or diagnostic data
- Your data remains on your device at all times

The only exception is Apple's App Groups feature, which allows the Asseta widget extension to read your net worth data to display it on your home screen. This data sharing occurs entirely within your device using Apple's secure App Groups technology.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:

- **Access**: You can view all your data within the App at any time
- **Modification**: You can edit, add, or delete assets and values at any time
- **Deletion**: You can delete individual assets or uninstall the App to remove all data
- **Export**: While not currently built into the App, your data can be accessed through iOS device backups

To completely remove all data: Uninstall the App from your device. All associated data will be deleted.

## Children's Privacy

Asseta is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any data, this is not a concern, but we include this statement for completeness.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App Store listing and updating the "Last Updated" date.

Your privacy is not just a policy—it's built into how Asseta works. All your financial data remains on your device, encrypted and private, exactly where it should be.
