## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I add an asset?

2. Enter a name for your asset (e.g., "Savings Account", "Investment Portfolio")
3. Tap "Create"
4. Swipe left on the asset or tap it to add a value

### How do I update an asset's value?

- **Swipe left** on an asset card and tap the "+" button, or
- **Tap on the asset** to open its detail view, then tap "Add Value"
- Enter the new value and date

### Can I track in different currencies?

Yes! Asseta supports 15+ currencies. Go to Settings to change your currency preference. All your assets will be displayed in the selected currency.

### Is my data private and secure?

Absolutely. Asseta stores all your data locally on your device using iOS's secure storage. Your financial data never leaves your device and is never transmitted to any servers. Your privacy is our priority.

### What is Anonymize Mode?

Anonymize Mode hides your actual dollar amounts while still showing you trends, percentages, and growth charts. This is useful if you want to track your progress without seeing exact values on screen.

The Asseta widget displays your current net worth and growth chart on your home screen. To add it:
1. Long press on your home screen
2. Tap the "+" button in the top left
3. Search for "Asseta"
4. Select the widget size you prefer
5. Tap "Add Widget"

### Can I use Asseta offline?

Yes! Asseta works completely offline. All your data is stored locally on your device, so you don't need an internet connection to use the app.

### How do I delete an asset?

Swipe right on an asset card and tap the trash icon. You'll be asked to confirm before deletion.

### Can I export my data?

Currently, your data is stored locally on your device. You can access it through iOS device backups. Export functionality may be added in future updates.

### I found a bug or have a feature request

We'd love to hear from you! Please email us at support@mi-apps.com with:
- A description of the issue or feature request
